# 3D Markers - GTA 5 Mod

----
## About

This mod allows you to select map markers and have the names rendered in the game world.

Rather than having to look back and forth at the mini-map, just add the marker to game world and keep your eyes on the road!

Markers can be added/removed in real-time with the mod menu, and up to 15 markers can be used at a time (this is a limitation due to the number of scaleforms available).
